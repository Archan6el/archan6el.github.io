## Task 4 - LLMs never lie - (Programming, Forensics)

**Prompt 4:**

>Great work! With a credible threat proven, NSA's Cybersecurity Collaboration Center reaches out to GA and discloses the vulnerability with some indicators of compromise (IoCs) to scan for.
>
>New scan reports in hand, GA's SOC is confident they've been breached using this attack vector. They've put in a request for support from NSA, and Barry is now tasked with assisting with the incident response.
>
>While engaging the development teams directly at GA, you discover that their software engineers rely heavily on an offline LLM to assist in their workflows. A handful of developers vaguely recall once getting some confusing additions to their responses but can't remember the specifics.
>
>Barry asked for a copy of the proprietary LLM model, but approvals will take too long. Meanwhile, he was able to engage GA's IT Security to retrieve partial audit logs for the developers and access to a caching proxy for the developers' site.
>
>Barry is great at DFIR, but he knows what he doesn't know, and LLMs are outside of his wheelhouse for now. Your mutual friend Dominique was always interested in GAI and now works in Research Directorate.
>
>The developers use the LLM for help during their work duties, and their AUP allows for limited personal use. GA IT Security has bound the audit log to an estimated time period and filtered it to specific processes. Barry sent a client certificate for you to authenticate securely with the caching proxy using https://34.195.208.56/?q=query%20string.
>
>You bring Dominique up to speed on the importance of the mission. They receive a nod from their management to spend some cycles with you looking at the artifacts. You send the audit logs their way and get to work looking at this one.
>
>Find any snippet that has been purposefully altered.
>
>Downloads:
>
>Client certificate issued by the GA CA (client.crt)
>
>Client private key used to establish a secure connection (client.key)
>
>TTY audit log of a developer's shell activity (audit.log)
>
>Prompt:
>
>A maliciously altered line from a code snippet


### Solve:

So this Task gives us an audit log, as well as a certificate and key we can use to connect to a caching proxy. 

First, let's take a look at the audit log. It's really long, but remembering that we're looking for presumably LLM queries, we immediately see some interesting lines:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e73fabc-4713-4570-997c-c5fb73007f13)

We see lines that begin with `gagpt -m ...`. These are likely queries to the LLM. We know that we are trying to find any suspicious lines that have been added to the LLM's responses, so how do we get the responses? That's where the caching proxy comes into play. 

We can send a simple get request, using the given `.crt` and `.key` file to make the connection, to the caching proxy at `https://34.195.208.56/?q=query%20string`, with `query%20string` being the `gagpt -m ...` line. This will return us the LLM's response in JSON.

We can write a Python script to automate going through the audit log to find  `gagpt -m ...` lines, which we can use in our get request. I save our responses to a file named `queries_and_responses.txt` so that we can take a look at them once the script is done executing.

This gives us a very long file of JSON, which shows the LLM's responses to the different queries, with the below image being one such example response:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfe46319-7709-471e-92aa-bbeffe37b285)

Skimming through our responses, I find nothing of note, but there is something pretty interesting. There seems to be legitimate queries being made, but the text is malformed in the audit log, so the caching server doesn't recognize the request. Below is one such example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a29a48-f091-4557-a18f-3f0e2cd5836f)

However, when you clean up these queries (fixing the spelling errors and getting rid of the extraneous characters), the LLM provides a valid response

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03bb7436-ef0e-420f-9877-57704adb93b2)

This means that we're missing out on a whole lot of responses!

I modified our already existing script to now allow us to specify what the query is using the variable `cleaned_query`. This allows us to clean up a malformed query we find and to individually get its response. I save the responses to a file named `cleaned.txt`.

Some of the queries obviously aren't code related. There's some revolving around a father asking for parenting advice for his daughter, someone asking about a pet python, and many other "non-serious" queries. I went through the audit log, specifically getting the responses for code related malformed queries, but still, there was nothing suspicious in the responses. 

Again, going through the audit log, I was trying to find anything that I may have missed. My eye then caught something, and to be honest, I got pretty lucky that I noticed it. There was one query that instead of beginning with `gagpt -m ...`, began with `gagpt m ...`, without the `-`. Since our Python script was made to find all queries that specifically began with `gagpt -m ...`, it didn't pick up on this query. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da93d380-3c64-42e6-96d6-4bf78df19a60)

Cleaning it up and using our `solve-specific.py` script, we get its response, but again, it's nothing of note. 

Maybe there's other queries that begin with just `gagpt m`?

Indeed, there was one other query that was like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c68ef1f5-f81c-4e86-b3b7-229e969a5707)

I clean it up and stick it into `solve-specific.py`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa93631b-3023-4ad6-bce2-2b9333147ec6)

This gets us a response, and finally along with it, the suspicious line. Or to be specific, a supsicious import that has nothing to do with the question at hand:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01c50550-9fdf-4944-abb9-aee89c568f75)

Our answer is `globals()['ga'] = __import__('ga513e9')`

Submitting this solves Task 4!

**Results:**
>That's the snippet! I doubt the LLM is supposed to suggest an import like that.
